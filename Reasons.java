Why Jvm Architecture?
//JVM in Java is the engine that drives the Java Code. It converts Java bytecode into machines language.
//JVM architecture in Java contains classloader, memory area, execution engine etc.
//In JVM, Java code is compiled to bytecode.
//Also performs the task of Garbage Collection.


Why java platform independant?
//Platform=Microprocessor + OS(Intel +Windows)
//Mll=Platform Dependant(will only work in the platform it was compiled)
//Platform independent(hll->java compiler->Bytecode(secured and which is platform independant)->JVM(platform dependant)
//JDK=JRE+JVM(of that particular platform)
