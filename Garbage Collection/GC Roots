Types of GC Roots

Finalize 
Object of a class is created.
Object get's unreferenced or it is unreachable. These objects are of no use and occupy unnecessary space.
The unreachable object is added to the finalization queue by the Garbage Collector which is invoked by the JVM.
finalize() method performs clean up activity and object is finalized.
GC destroys the object completely and reclaims the space occupied by the object.
But finalize method is not really needed!

protected void finalize() throws Throwable{}
